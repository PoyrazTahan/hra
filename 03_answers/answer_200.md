This group shows dramatically elevated health risks that compound the individual effects of both gender and smoking status. Companies should implement gender-specific smoking cessation programs with specialized support for female employees, addressing both the health and social factors that contribute to persistent smoking behavior in this population.

Employees reporting moderate physical pain show dramatically elevated health risks that extend far beyond the pain itself. This suggests that moderate pain serves as an early warning indicator for broader health deterioration, often accompanied by reduced activity levels and increased stress. Companies should implement early intervention programs for employees reporting persistent pain, including ergonomic assessments, physical therapy access, and pain management resources before conditions worsen.

The stark contrast in nutrition quality across the workforce reveals a critical intervention opportunity, with 90% of employees having poor to very poor fruit and vegetable intake. This widespread nutritional deficiency likely underlies many other health risks and represents an foundational wellness issue. Companies should implement comprehensive nutrition education programs, improve workplace food options, and provide subsidized access to healthy meals to address this fundamental health infrastructure gap.

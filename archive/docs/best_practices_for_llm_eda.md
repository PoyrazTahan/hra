# Best Practices for LLM-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (2025)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines evidence-based best practices for preparing structured data for Large Language Model (LLM) analysis. The goal is to optimize token efficiency while preserving semantic meaning and analytical value.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Structured Data Over Pure Tokenization**
- Modern LLMs (2025) perform better with structured data formats (JSON, XML) rather than plain text tokenization
- Use consistent field naming conventions and hierarchical structures
- Preserve relationships between data points through structured organization

### 2. **Semantic Preservation vs Token Efficiency**
- **Balance Point**: Reduce verbosity without losing meaning
- Use standardized categorical mappings with clear semantic labels
- Include context metadata to maintain interpretability
- Avoid pure numeric encoding (0,1,2,3) without semantic anchors

### 3. **Health Data Specific Considerations**
- Maintain clinical terminology accuracy
- Preserve severity/frequency scales with clear semantic meaning
- Include units and ranges for quantitative measures
- Consider regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR) in data structure

## Data Preprocessing Framework

### Phase 1: Standardization
```json
{
  "field_type": "categorical_ordered",
  "original": "Çoğu zaman stresli hissederim",
  "standardized": "stress_level_high",
  "semantic_label": "High Stress (Most of the time)",
  "scale_position": 4,
  "scale_range": "1-5"
}
```

### Phase 2: Token Optimization Strategies

#### **Categorical Data Encoding**
- ✅ **Good**: `activity_level: "moderate_regular"`  
- ❌ **Avoid**: `activity_level: 2`
- ✅ **Better**: `activity_level: "moderate" // Regular daily walking, simple home exercises`

#### **Frequency Scales**
- ✅ **Standardized**: `never | rarely | sometimes | often | always`
- ✅ **With Context**: `sleep_quality: "poor_frequent" // 1-2 times per week`

#### **Numerical Data**
- ✅ **Binned with Labels**: `bmi_category: "normal" // 18.5-24.9`
- ✅ **Range Descriptors**: `age_group: "young_adult" // 25-34 years`

### Phase 3: Metadata Integration

Include contextual information that helps LLMs understand data semantics:

```json
{
  "data_dictionary": {
    "smoking_status": {
      "type": "ordinal_categorical",
      "values": ["never", "former", "social", "regular", "heavy"],
      "health_impact": "ascending_risk",
      "clinical_relevance": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

## Token Optimization Techniques

### 1. **Abbreviation Standards**
- Use domain-standard abbreviations: `BMI` not `Body Mass Index`
- Create consistent short forms: `ex_freq` for `exercise_frequency`
- Maintain readability: `stress_hi` not `str_h`

### 2. **Hierarchical Grouping**
```json
{
  "mental_health": {
    "stress": "high",
    "sleep": "poor", 
    "mood": "low"
  },
  "physical_health": {
    "activity": "moderate",
    "pain": "mild",
    "bmi": "normal"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Smart Chunking**
- Group related fields logically
- Include cross-field relationships
- Preserve analytical context within chunks

## LLM-Specific Formatting

### JSON Structure for Analysis
```json
{
  "participant_id": "P001",
  "demographics": {
    "age_group": "middle_aged",
    "gender": "female",
    "children": "yes"
  },
  "health_metrics": {
    "mental": {
      "stress": "moderate // Sometimes stressed",
      "sleep": "good // 7-8 hours, refreshed",
      "mood": "positive // Generally happy"
    },
    "physical": {
      "activity": "high // Daily exercise, sports",
      "nutrition": "good // Regular fruits/vegetables",
      "habits": "healthy // Non-smoker, minimal alcohol"
    }
  },
  "risk_indicators": ["stress_moderate", "activity_high"],
  "wellness_score": "good"
}
```

## Quality Control Standards

### 1. **Validation Checks**
- Semantic consistency across similar fields
- Logical relationships (high activity + good nutrition)
- Missing data handling with meaningful labels

### 2. **Context Preservation**
- Include reference ranges for all scaled responses  
- Maintain temporal context (time periods for questions)
- Preserve clinical significance indicators

### 3. **Privacy Safeguards**
- Remove direct identifiers
- Use secure hashing for IDs
- Apply differential privacy where appropriate

## Performance Metrics

### Token Efficiency
- Target: 40-60% reduction from verbose original
- Measure: tokens per semantic unit preserved
- Benchmark: Clinical accuracy maintained

### Semantic Preservation
- Human validation of meaning retention
- Cross-model consistency tests
- Domain expert review for clinical accuracy

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Development Workflow**
1. Analyze original data semantic structure
2. Create standardization mappings
3. Implement preprocessing pipeline
4. Validate with domain experts
5. Test with multiple LLM models
6. Monitor performance metrics

### 2. **Documentation Requirements**
- Data dictionary with all transformations
- Semantic mapping tables
- Quality control reports
- Model performance benchmarks

### 3. **Maintenance Standards**
- Regular validation against new data
- Update mappings based on LLM evolution
- Monitor for semantic drift
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Technology Stack Recommendations (2025)

### Primary Tools
- **Preprocessing**: Python pandas, JSON schema validation
- **LLM Testing**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek R1
- **Validation**: Human-in-the-loop annotation tools
- **Storage**: Structured formats (JSON-LD, Parquet with metadata)

### Quality Assurance
- Automated semantic consistency checks
- Statistical validation of distributions
- Clinical expert review workflows
- Multi-model cross-validation

## Conclusion

Effective LLM-based EDA requires balancing token efficiency with semantic preservation. The key is structured data formats with clear semantic labels, comprehensive metadata, and domain-specific validation. This approach enables LLMs to perform accurate analysis while maintaining interpretability and clinical relevance.
